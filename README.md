# CS240A
This repository contains the final project for the course CS240A-Databases and Knowledge Bases that I took at UCLA.

The main aim of this project was to implement some popular data mining algorithms in declarative systems and also explore the challenges and difficulties faced from a programmer's point of view. 

We implemented Naive Bayes and KNN algorithms in DB2 and Datalog Systems.
